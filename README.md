# terminal-velocity
This is a program to calculate the terminal velocity of a free-falling object. This program is nowhere near as close to achieving real world solutions.

#### What am I doing:
- Calculating Terminal Velocity.
- Have the basic math formula, continuing to research on the theory aspect of it.

#### If I ever figure out how this whole thing works, I will update here for sure.
